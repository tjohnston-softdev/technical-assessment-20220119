# Technical Assessment (2022-01-19)

This is my submission to a coding assessment given to shortlisted candidates for a software development position that I applied for. The assessment consisted of several questions related to both interpreting existing code and writing new functions to accomplish a particular task. The questions included a mix of SQL, C#, and JavaScript code.

My attempt at this assessment was made on 19 January 2021. It was converted to markdown and shared publicly on 27 January.
